### Bonus 1

Improve the mouse so it behaves like a real paintbrush. In other words, allow the user to paint by clicking and dragging across the canvas. For this, you'll need a combination of the `mousedown`, `mouseenter`, and `mouseup` events.

**TIP:** The [`mouseenter` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/mouseenter) doesn't bubble up the DOM tree.

### Bonus 2

Add a color picker which allows the user to select any brush color using the [`<input type="color">` tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/color) and the [`change` event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/change).

### Bonus 3

Research [LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/LocalStorage) and make a way to Save and Load a drawing.  Research [JSON.stringify](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) and [JSON.parse](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) as a way to put the drawing into LocalStorage.

### Bonus 4

Create a fill tool that will [flood fill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill) boundaries with a chosen paint color.

A good domain name for this project is `USERNAME-pixel-art-maker.surge.sh` where `USERNAME` is your GitHub username in all **lowercase** letters. Once deployed and everything works as you expect, copy your Surge URL and paste it at the top of your GitHub repository's page.
